We all know that Google is integrated their Germany feature in their almost product.

00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,560

00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:31,439
So I made one kind of Chrome extension that self you to understanding your Google Class

6
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:32,439
room documentation.

7
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:36,000
You can ask any question about your classroom documentation.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,399
It will help you to answering.

00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:46,719

Head there and data blah blah.

15
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,919
This line of code is creating a new instance of SK1XM class.

00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:29,080
I open a combination logic video and just ask about video random things.

21
00:02:49,080 --> 00:03:11,200
