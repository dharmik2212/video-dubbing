So I made one kind of Chrome extension that self you to understanding your Google Classroom documentation. You can ask any question about your classroom documentation. It will help you to answering. Let me show you. So all I want to randomly documentation. Let's ask about our SQL connection class. You can see that guys. SQL connection equal to new I-SK1X on. Head there and data blah blah. This line of code is creating a new instance of SK1XM class. We all know that it reply very well. Let's start. Try again. I open a combination logic video and just ask about video random things.
